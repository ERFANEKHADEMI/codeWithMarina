### Hello there! 👋

👩‍💻 Hi, I'm Marina, a frontend developer from the State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia. 🎨 After studying art, I got into designing digital stuff. Then, four years ago, I started coding websites and apps.

🔭 Right now, I'm focusing on creating awesome user experiences with JavaScript and mastering frontend frameworks like React and Angular.

🌱 I'm always excited to learn new tech stuff.

😄 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I like doodling in my code editor! 🎨✏️
