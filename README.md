### Hello there! 👋

👩‍💻 Hello, I'm Marina. I studied art at the State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia 🎨 and then moved into digital design. Four years ago, I began programming websites and apps.

🔭 Right now, I'm focusing on creating awesome user experiences with JavaScript and mastering frontend frameworks like React and Angular.

🌱 I'm always excited to learn new tech stuff.

😄 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I like doodling in my code editor! 🎨✏️
